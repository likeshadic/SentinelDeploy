# SentinelDeploy
##Description
SentinelDeploy is a DevSecOps-focused deployment platform that automates the secure build and deployment of containerized applications on Microsoft Azure.

The project demonstrates production-oriented DevOps practices, including infrastructure as code with Terraform, CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, container image and infrastructure security scanning, secrets management using Azure Key Vault and managed identities, and centralized logging and monitoring with Azure Monitor and Application Insights.

SentinelDeploy is designed to showcase how security can be embedded directly into modern cloud deployment workflows without slowing down delivery.
